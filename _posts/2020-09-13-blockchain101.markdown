###### Lets talk blockchain- Yet if you don't know what blockchain is then I guess you are in a right place, of course. Firstly let us start with some basic introduction of blockchain, some terminologies; and then we will jump into the main portion. So, letâ€™s get started.
#### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a ledger of transactions where blocks keep goes on adding when new transaction occurs on blockchain. It is a peer-to-peer(P2P) network that is cryptographically secured and immutable.
#### Some basic terminologies
The first thing that I do whenever studying a new domain is I look into every new terminologies that I haven't heard before about that domain. So before jumping into the main section lets look into some basic terminologies which you will stumble upon frequently.
- P2P: It means every nodes on the network are interconnected to each other with no central governing body.
- Distributed ledger: It means that a ledger is spread across all over the network and each node hold on to a copy of the complete ledger. Blockchain is based on this technology. 
- Hashing: It plays a vital role in blockchain. Hashing means converting a plain text into a hashed value using different hash functions. You might have heard *Md5*(Message digest) before, if not its one of among hash functions used in hashing. Similarly there other hash functions as well like SHA(Secure hash algorithm), RIPEMD, Whirlpool, so on and so forth.
- Consensus: It is an agreement among peers to agree on a propose state or value. It is the backbone of a blockchain.
- POW(Proof of work): A type of consensus mechanism which is a proof that enough computational rescources have been spent in order to build a valid block.
- POS(Proof of stack): It is also a type of consensus mechanism which works on the idea that a user has an adequate stake in the system.
-  Web3: This is the vision of the decentralized web that will revolutionize the way we use the internet today. This is the era that will be fully user-centralized without any involvement of single authority.
- Smart contracts: It is a software program that runs on blockchain. They run autonomously on behalf of the network participants.
- Dapps: Dapps are similar to other applications we use in our day-to-day life; the only difference between the typical applications and dapp is, dapp makes use of blockchain whereas typical applications don't.

- Defi: It is a blockchain based finance which doesn't relies on third party. Defi is considered to be the killer app of the decentralized revolution.

#### How blockchain works?
 In simple words, how a blockchain works is all about how a block is generated in the network. In this process node plays a vital role, nodes are either miners who create new blocks and block signers who validate and digitally sign the transactions. Decision to make which node will append the next block in blockchain is made by consensus mechanism.
 Blockchain process involves 5 simple scheme for creating blocks:
1. Transaction established:<br>
A node starts a transaction by first creating it and digitally signing it with a private key. The transaction data structures usually consists of header, address, value.
1. Validating and broadcasting:<br>
A transaction is validated before broadcasted. It is propagated usually by using data-dissemination protocol.
1. Find new block:<br>
Miners are those who are listening for the transactions verify and include this transaction in the next block to be mined. Miners race to find a new block and gets rewarded.
1. New block found:<br>
Once a miner solves the POW problem(puzzle), the newly mined block is brodcasted to the network. The nodes verify the block and propagate the block further, and confirmations start to generate.
<p>Once the block is generated it now becomes the part of blockchain(ledger) and the next block links itself cryptographically back to this block. The link is called a hash point.</p>

#### Types of blockchain 
There are basically 4 main types of blockchain: public blockchains, private blockchains, semi-private blockchains and sidechains. We will briefly describe each types.
1. Public blockchain:<br>
As the itself suggests these are publically open sourced. Aanyone can participate as a node in the decision-making process.
