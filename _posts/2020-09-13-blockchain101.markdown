###### Lets talk blockchain- Yet if you don't know what blockchain is then I guess you are in a right place, of course. Firstly let us start with some basic introduction of blockchain, some terminologies; and then we will jump into the main portion.
#### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a ledger of transactions where blocks keep goes on adding when new transaction occurs on blockchain. It is a peer-to-peer(P2P) network that is cryptographically secured and immutable.
#### Some basic terminologies
The first thing that I do whenever studying a new domain is I look into every new terminologies that I haven't heard before about that domain. So before jumping into the main section lets look into some basic terminologies which you will stumble upon frequently.
- P2P: It means every nodes on the network are interconnected to each other with no central governing body.
- Distributed ledger: It means that a ledger is spread across all over the network and each node hold on to a copy of the complete ledger. Blockchain is based on this technology. 
- Hashing: It plays a vital role in blockchain. Hashing means converting a plain text into a hashed value using different hash functions. You might have heard *Md5*(Message digest) before, if not its one of among hash functions used in hashing. Similarly there other hash functions as well like SHA(Secure hash algorithm), RIPEMD, Whirlpool, so on and so forth.
- Consensus: It is an agreement among peers to agree on a propose state or value. It is the backbone of a blockchain.
- POW(Proof of work): A type of consensus mechanism which is a proof that enough computational rescources have been spent in order to build a valid block.
- POS(Proof of stack): It is also a type of consensus mechanism which works on the idea that a user has an adequate stake in the system.
- Smart contracts: It is a software program that runs on blockchain. They run autonomously on behalf of the network participants.
- Dapps: Dapps are similar to other applications we use in our day-to-day life; the only difference between the typical applications and dapp is, dapp makes use of blockchain whereas typical applications don't.
